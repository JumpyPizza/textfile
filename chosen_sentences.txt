In the realm of mathematical analysis, one might contemplate that the notion of a sequence having the property of convergence towards a specific limit inherently implies its classification as convergent; contrariwise, in the absence of such convergence, it necessarily follows that the sequence must be adjudged divergent.	A sequence converges if it approaches a limit, otherwise it is divergent.	C	If a sequence converges to some limit , then it is convergent ; otherwise it is divergent .	A sequence is convergent if it gets close to a number. If it does not, it is divergent.
The raw, unencrypted data, referred to as plaintext, undergoes processing through a cryptographic algorithm, frequently culminating in a transformed output known as ciphertext, especially when said algorithm is identified as a cipher.	Plaintext becomes ciphertext after a cipher processes it.	C	Plaintext is used as input to an encryption algorithm ; the output is usually termed ciphertext , particularly when the algorithm is a cipher .

Embryo transfer happens after different embryo culture durations, involving multiple embryo development stages.	C	Embryo transfer can be performed after various durations of embryo culture , conferring different stages in embryogenesis .	Embryo transfer happens after different times of growing embryos and includes many parts of embryo development.
Cerebellar ataxia, characterized by a disordered coordination of voluntary movements, arises from pathological aberrations, structural anomalies, or functional impairments within the cerebellum, an integral part of the central nervous system responsible for the regulation and fine-tuning of motor functions.	Cerebellar ataxia results from cerebellum issues, leading to uncoordinated movements.	C	Cerebellar ataxia is ataxia that is caused by a problem with a person 's cerebellum .	The cerebellum helps control our movements, and problems in it can make our movements uncoordinated.
A white dwarf, in eventuality, possesses the potentiality to engender a multiplicity of novae throughout an extended temporal continuum, contingent upon the ceaseless accretion of supplementary hydrogen onto its outer strata, derived from its stellar companion.	A white dwarf can create multiple novae over time if it continuously gathers hydrogen from its companion star.	C	Potentially , a white dwarf can generate multiple novae over time as additional hydrogen continues to accrete onto its surface from its companion star .	A white dwarf can make many new stars over a long time if it keeps getting more hydrogen from a star next to it.
The Paridae family, characteristically insectivorous, exhibits a dietary predilection for an extensive array of diminutive arthropods and invertebrates, with a pronounced preference for folivorous lepidopteran larvae, thereby playing a pivotal role in the trophic dynamics of their respective ecosystems.	Paridae birds mainly eat small insects and lepidopteran larvae, influencing their ecosystems.	C	The tits are insectivorous , and eat a wide range of small insects and other invertebrates , particularly small leaf-eating caterpillars .	Birds in the Paridae family like small bugs and often eat caterpillar babies.
Among the pioneering discoveries in enzymology, pepsin, inherently polypeptidic, holds a place of distinction.	Pepsin is a notable enzyme known for breaking down proteins.	C	Pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered , and is polypeptidic in nature .	Pepsin is an important enzyme that breaks down proteins.

Lithium peroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate.	C	Lithium carbonate is generated by combining lithium peroxide with carbon dioxide .	Lithium peroxide and carbon dioxide mix to make lithium carbonate.
By the year 2008, the most sophisticated and rigorously peer-reviewed cryptanalytic examination of the Twofish block cipher, an encryption algorithm developed in the late 1990s by a team led by renowned cryptographer Bruce Schneier, was a truncated differential cryptanalysis targeting the entirety of its 16-round iteration, representing a significant milestone in the field of cryptography.	By 2008, a significant cryptanalysis of Twofish, a 16-round cipher, was completed using truncated differential cryptanalysis.	C	As of 2008 , the best published cryptanalysis on the Twofish block cipher is a truncated differential cryptanalysis of the full 16 - round version .	In 2008, experts studied the Twofish cipher and found a way to break it in 16 rounds.
